# PES JK Launcher
Repo for PES JK Launcher. Thanks for the Mr. JK for keeping the patch and content alive!

Quickstart:
Open the .sln file with Visual Studio — run it, modify it, break it, whatever.

## ⚠️ For Contributors
Heads up — this ain’t the latest build I sent to Mr. JK. I forgot to push the latest one before my old laptop went kaput.
If you’re down to contribute, ping me. I might be able to replicate the latest updates when I get some free time — no promises though.

## Roadmap (aka shit I might do when I feel like it)
Just crawled back from hiatus — didn’t expect this patch to blow up like this. Guess that’s enough reason to reignite the flame.
## Potential updates if I’m not too busy:
- Cleaner, better-looking UI
- More efficient memory management
- Infra rework to make collab less annoying
- Localization (yea, maybe)
- Responsive UI? Meh, maybe. This patch’s users mostly run laptops with at least 1280x720 anyway.

Will update the roadmap after checking in with Mr. JK, he knows best of what was needed.
